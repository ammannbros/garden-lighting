The overall functionality is very simple. It offers a I2C interface to be addressed by any standard purpose Microcontroller. The boards heard is the well known MCP23017 IO-Expander(input-output) from Microchip. [http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21952b.pdf](16-Bit I/O Expander with Serial Interface)\r\n\r\nSo the output registers of the chip can be written via I2C. The output registers are connected to a standard OR-Gate to allow the user to control the relys manually through a simple switch. The two inputs are the Output of the MCP23017 registers and the debounced switch. The output of the OR-Gate controles a TTL-Logic-Level MOSFET which switches the indudctors of the rails. (An EAGLE schematic is available in repository for more details)\r\n***\r\n![RelaisArray, front and back view](https://github.com/ammannbros/garden-lighting/blob/master/PICS/board_1.0_assembled1.jpg?raw=true)\r\n***\r\n![RelaisArray, front back view](https://github.com/ammannbros/garden-lighting/blob/master/PICS/board_1.0_assembled2.JPG?raw=true)\r\n***\r\n###Issues\r\nA major Issue was, that the MCP2017 resetted after switching the relias if consumers were connected. The relais induced noise to the 12V power line. This noise caused a voltage drop on the reset line of the MCP2017. So after switching the configuration of the Chip got lost. A capacitor from the reset-pin to ground solved the problem.\r\n\r\n###Possible Improvements\r\nIf the load which is connected to the relais is known, a Snubber could be added to improve the durabiltiy of the relays.\r\n\r\n###Characteristics\r\n- Controlable via I2C\r\n- I2C Pullups not included (to provide the opporunity to use a Raspberry PI)\r\n- 12V Power supply needed\r\n- Designed for 230V/16A Switching load \r\n- 8 independet Channels\r\n\r\n##Hardware - Overall System\r\nThe Overall System include a RaspberryPI2 which runs a website to control the hardware. So a cheap 12V -> 5V stepdown converter for the raspberry power supply was ordered from china (ebay). A 12V powersuppy is needed for the RelaisArrays.\r\nAll compontens are included in a IP55-Metal case so provide an earth wire protection. \r\n***\r\n![Overall System](https://github.com/ammannbros/garden-lighting/blob/master/PICS/system1.jpg?raw=true)\r\n***\r\n![Overall System](https://github.com/ammannbros/garden-lighting/blob/master/PICS/system2.jpg?raw=true)\r\n***","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
