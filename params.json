{"name":"Garden-lighting","tagline":"Command center of our imperial residence","body":"### Welcome to our short Project Documentation\r\n\r\n###Hardware\r\n##RelaisArray\r\nThe board was designed for low power consumption. The overall functionality is very simple. It offers a I2C interface to be addressed by any standard purpose Microcontroller. The boards heard is the well known MCP23017 IO-Expander(input-output) from Microchip. \r\n\r\nSo the output registers of the chip can be written via I2C. The output registers are connected to a standard OR-Gate to allow the user to control the relys manually through a simple switch. The two inputs are the Output of the MCP23017 registers and the debounced switch. The output of the OR-Gate controles a TTL-Logic-Level MOSFET which switches the indudctors of the rails. (An EAGLE schematic is available for more details)\r\n\r\n![RelaisArray, front and back view](https://github.com/ammannbros/garden-lighting/blob/master/PICS/board_1.0_assembled1.jpg)\r\n\r\n##Issues\r\nA major Issue was, that the MCP2017 resetted after switching the relias if consumers were connected. The relais induced noise to the 12V power line. This noise caused a voltage drop on the reset line of the MCP2017. So after switching the configuration of the Chip got lost. A capacitor from the reset-pin to ground solved the problem.\r\n\r\n##Improvements\r\nIf the load which is connected to the relais is known, a Snubber could be added to improve the durabiltiy of the relays.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
